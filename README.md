# vehicle-showroom
A vehicle showroom system built with "Builder Design Pattern", implemented with C++.


Make a Command Line System for Vehicle Showroom. As it is a vehicle showroom, so it will have some vehicles in it. A "Vehicle" has following descriptions:
  1. model number
  2. engine type
    
    There are three types of engines
      a) oil
      b) gas
      c) diesel
  3. engine power
  4. tire size

In the vehicle showroom there are 3 types of vehicles
  - Normal Vehicles, 
  - Sports Vehicles & 
  - Heavy Vehicles.
  
For "Normal Vehicle" There is no extra property, so it will have all the descriptions as above described descriptions of a "Vehicle".

For "Sports Vehicle" There are two extra properties or attributes you can say. And these are :
  1. turbo
  2. engine type is oil only

For "Heavy Vehicle" There are also two extra properties or attributes you can say. And these are :
  1. weight
  2. engine type is diesel only

Now, your system should be able to have following functionalities:
  a. Add any type of vehicle in showroom.
  b. Remove any of the vehicles from showroom.
  c. Show the vehicle lists with details currently have in showroom.
  
Here comes the exciting part. Without visitors a vehicle showroom is not good, right?
The regular expected visitor count of the vehicle showroom is 30.
But whenever we add a new "Sports Vehicle" in the showroom the expected visitor count increase by 20.
So here comes a new functionality to your system:
  d. Show the list of vehicles with current expected visitor count
  
There is no boundary regarding the console panel representation. You should represent it in your creative way.
You can also add extra properties to your vehicle details if you need and even the data types for the attributes are all to you.
But whatever described above is a must have.
Enjoy yourself making Vehicle Showroom System. :)
